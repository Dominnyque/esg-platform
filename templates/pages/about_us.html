      </div>

      <p class="font-medium mb-4 text-justify">
        The urgent need to raise awareness and advocate for climate-neutral sports has never been more critical. The global sports industry, a powerhouse of entertainment and competition, is simultaneously contributing to the escalating challenge of global warming through its substantial carbon footprint. Estimates suggest the global sports industry is responsible for approximately 350 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e ) on a yearly basis. In 2022, the FIFA World Cup Qatar generated an estimated 3.63 million tonnes of CO2e, while the total carbon footprint of the Tokyo Olympics 2020 was 1.96 million tCO2e.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify ">
        As athletes and teams capture the world's attention, it becomes paramount for the sports industry to take a leading role in mitigating its environmental impact. By adopting sustainable practices, sports clubs can pave the way for change, influencing not only their own operations but also inspiring fans worldwide to embrace eco-conscious behaviors. The collective effort to reduce and offset the carbon footprint within the sports community is not just an option; it is a responsibility we owe to the planet. Now is the time for a transformative shift towards climate-neutral sports, where the passion for the game aligns harmoniously with a commitment to environmental stewardship, ensuring a sustainable legacy for generations to come. This is the mission of Climate Neutral Sports.

      <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto mb-4 text-justify">
        Simply speaking, we have developed climate projects to mitigate, reduce, and remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. To achieve this, we are asking sports clubs and fans to contribute to these projects through our offsetting program. In other words, when a sports club or a fan compensates its carbon footprint, he also indirectly funds a program that contributes to financing global climate action.
      </p>
      <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto mb-4 text-justify">Traditionally, climate programs aim to reduce carbon emissions, protect biodiversity, and bring real benefits to local communities. There are various programs in which every organization or person can be involved, such as reforestation, biogas and biomass, solar energy, improved cook stoves, biodiversity, and plastic waste, just to name a few, all of which contribute to improving our planet while also impacting the lives of local communities where the projects are being implemented.
        <strong>We at CNS have decided to build playgrounds and other light sporting facilities in the global South (Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia) with recycled material (mainly plastic); thus, we put a strong emphasis on achieving the SDGs while ensuring circularity within the sport industry. </strong>

        <p class="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Climate Neutral Sports (CNS) only deals with Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM), while there is another market, called the Mandatory (compliance) Market (MCM). Mandatory (Compliance) Markets are governed by national, regional, or provincial law and compel emission sources to meet GHG emission reduction targets. Because compliance program offset credits are generated and traded for regulatory compliance, they typically act like other commodity pricing.  While Voluntary Carbon Markets enable carbon emitters to offset their unavoidable emissions by acquiring carbon credits generated by initiatives aimed at removing or decreasing GHG emissions from the environment. Companies can engage in the voluntary carbon market on their own or as part of an industry-wide program. </p>

            Carbon prices on the VCM can vary for several reasons, reflecting the complexity and diversity of the market. There are some key factors that contribute to the differences in carbon prices, such as market dynamics (demand and supply), quality and types of carbon credits, geographical locations, buyer preferences, project development costs, etc.
            In summary, the VCM is influenced by a combination of economic, environmental, and social factors. The diverse nature of carbon offset projects, coupled with varying market conditions, buyer preferences, and regulatory landscapes, contributes to the range of carbon prices observed in the voluntary carbon market.

            A carbon offset is a unit of measurement representing the reduction, removal, or avoidance of one metric ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) or its equivalent in other greenhouse gas emissions. Individuals, businesses, sport clubs, or governments can purchase these offsets as a way to compensate for their own carbon emissions by investing in projects that reduce or capture an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases elsewhere. Carbon offset projects often include initiatives such as renewable energy projects, reforestation efforts, methane capture, and other activities aimed at mitigating climate change. The concept is based on the idea of balancing carbon footprints by supporting activities that contribute to a net reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions.

            Climate neutrality, also known as carbon neutrality, is the state achieved when an entity, such as an individual, organization, or nation, balances the amount of greenhouse gases it emits with an equivalent amount of emissions removed or offset. Achieving climate neutrality involves reducing emissions through sustainable practices, energy efficiency, and the use of renewable energy sources. Any remaining emissions may be offset by investing in projects that sequester or reduce an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases. The goal of climate neutrality is to contribute to global efforts to mitigate climate change by ensuring that the net impact on the climate is zero or near-zero.

This approach not only maximizes the value of the funds invested, but also aligns with the broader objective of contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By concentrating on regions facing significant environmental challenges, CNS endeavors to create a positive ripple effect, fostering both environmental and social advancements in communities that need it most.

            Climate Neutral Sports (CNS) employs a rigorous methodology to calculate the carbon footprint associated with both sport clubs and fans, adhering to the internationally recognized GHG Protocol standards. The calculation process encompasses the three distinct scopes as outlined in international standards: Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from purchased energy), and Scope 3 (indirect emissions from activities outside the organization's direct control). Our dedicated team conducts thorough research to understand the intricacies of sport club operations and the habits of sport fans, ensuring a comprehensive and accurate assessment. By utilizing the GHG Protocol standards, CNS ensures transparency, consistency, and alignment with global best practices in carbon accounting, enabling us to quantify and offset the environmental impact of sports-related activities in a credible and standardized manner.

            It's important to note that Climate Neutral Sports (CNS) operates as a company rather than a non-profit organization. As such, carbon offset purchases made with CNS are not considered donations, and, consequently, they are not eligible for tax deductions. The funds generated through these purchases are utilized to finance the specific projects outlined by CNS, contributing to the company's mission of promoting sustainability within the sports industry. While CNS is committed to environmental and social impact, its structure as a company distinguishes the nature of carbon offset transactions from traditional charitable donations.
